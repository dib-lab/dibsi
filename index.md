## 2018 Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute at UC Davis

From June 25th - July 14th, we're planning to run several
computational training events at the University of California, Davis
-- the main event will be the 9th annual ANGUS workshop, a two-week
workshop for biologists to learn basic bioinformatics and cloud
computing.  We are also planning a Software Carpentry Instructor
Training, several Software and Data Carpentry workshops, and a
West Coast CarpentryCon.

All of this will be taking place at the UC Davis School of Veterinary
Medicine, on the main campus of UC Davis (in Davis,
CA). [Read more...](VENUE.html)

Everyone is welcome, from everywhere! Grad students, postdocs,
faculty, staff, industry, non-profits, teachers, journalists, and
grant managers may all find these workshops useful. **We welcome
applications from international students.**

The two week workshop will cost approximately $850, and room & board
will be approximately $970 total for non-local attendees (excluding
lunch).
