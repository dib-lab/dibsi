# Venue information - travel to and from, local entertainment, and transportation.

## Where DIBSI 2018 will happen

The venue for the Summer Institute is the
[Valley Hall](http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/Academic_Programs/map/ValleyHall/)
teaching facility, located on the Health Sciences side of UC Davis
main campus, in Davis, CA.  ([Google maps link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gladys+Valley+Hall,+Davis,+CA+95616/@38.5328167,-121.7659017,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80852902c9d969a7:0xaa647225d10f76a3!8m2!3d38.5328167!4d-121.7637077))

## Davis and Davis area.

Davis is a lovely town, with a walking-friendly downtown that has lots
of restaurants, bars, and boutiques.  The Davis Farmer's Market takes
place on Saturday mornings and Wednesday afternoons, with live music
and picnicing opportunities on Wednesdays during the summer.

Davis is "centrally isolated" - you can get to San Francisco, Lake
Tahoe, a number of state and national parks (including Big Basin
Redwood State Park and Lassen National Parks), and Napa Valley within
2-3 hours.  Yosemite and the California coast, including Big Sur and
Redwood National and State Parks, are 3-5 hours away.  Moreover, many
large cities on the West coast, including Vancouver, Portland,
Seattle, LA, and San Diego, can be reached within a few hours by
flight.

## Lodging information

On-campus lodging is being arranged through
[Conference Housing Services](http://confhsg.ucdavis.edu/hostingaconference/rates/).
We have reserved space, and non-UC Davis attendees are expected to
stay in housing.  Note, due to space constraints, we cannot guarantee
single-room lodging for attendees, although in 2017 we were able to
give everyone a single.

## Travel to and from Davis.

Davis is located about 60 miles north of the Bay Area and 20 miles west of
Sacramento.

Davis can be reached in about 30 minutes from the Sacramento
International Airport (SMF), and is about an hour away from Oakland
Airport (OAK?), and between 2 and 3 hours away from the San Francisco
airport (SFO).  There is frequent serious highway congestion between Davis
and the Bay Area which should be accounted for in travel plans.

Public transportation from OAK and SFO is possible via BART (metro)
and Amtrak, which arrives in downtown Davis.  While much of downtown
Davis is walkable, lodging is typically further and we recommend
using ride sharing or taxi services.

[The Davis Airporter](https://www.davisairporter.com/index2.html) and
[Supershuttle](https://www.supershuttle.com/) can be used for
transportation to and from airports, but should be reserved well in
advance.  Ride sharing (e.g. [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/)) works well
for local travel (to/from SMF).

### Visa information for international travelers.

One attendee received the following information from their local US
consulate:

  You may apply for and request [ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/)
  authorization under the Visa Waiver Program, which allows you to
  stay in the U.S. for 90 days or less.  You may not exceed 90 days.
  If you plan to stay for longer than 90 days, you must apply for and
  obtain a visa beforehand.

Upon request to
[dibsi.training@gmail.com](mailto:dibsi.training@gmail.com) we can
provide invitation letters for people coming from outside the country.

Note that we will provide full tuition and housing refunds to those
who are unable to enter the country due to visa issues, irrespective
of the official deadlines.

## Transportation needs in Davis

A car is typically not needed in Davis, as the weather is almost
always good.  On campus housing is a short walk from drugstores and
supermarkets, and a medium walk (~20 minutes) to downtown.  Davis is
very bike friendly and bike rentals are available on a daily or weekly
basis (from [Ken's Bike and Ski](http://kensbikeski.com/) and also the
[UC Davis Bike Barn](https://bikebarn.ucdavis.edu/rentals/)).  There
are also a number of [ZipCar](http://zipcar.com) locations on and near
campus for hourly car rental, and Uber and Lyft work well within town
during the day and evening.

The venue for the Summer Institute is the
[Valley Hall](http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/Academic_Programs/map/ValleyHall/)
teaching facility, located on the Health Sciences side of UC Davis
main campus.  It should be no more than a 15 minute walk from any
on-campus housing, and no more than a 25 minute bike ride from any
location in Davis.  During the summer there is ample on-site parking
for about $9/day - see parking lots 50, 53, and 55.  Breakfasts,
lunches and dinners will be close to the workshop rooms and lodging;
note that breakfast and dinner are covered only if you are in the
conference housing, and lunch is not covered by the housing
plan. Lunch each day should be about $10/day if you eat at the cafe.

## Weather and attire.

Summers in Davis are almost uniformly sunny, dry, and *hot*, reaching
temperatures of up to 110 deg F (38 deg C).  We recommend bringing
water bottles, hats, and sunscreen.

The workshops have no dress requirement and informal-wear (flip-flops
and shorts!) are fine, although we do also have strong functioning air
conditioning in the classrooms, so you might also bring some warm
clothes.

## Family and partners

Davis is very family friendly, and kids and partners are welcome at all
social events.  California is in general LGBTQ-friendly as well.

Please inquire if you want to stay on campus with a partner or your
family.  Note that there are some hotels that have family-suitable
suites. We can also point you towards some local summer programs for
children that offer spots on a week-by-week basis.

## Special requirements

Any special requirements (whether dietary, transportation, or family
related) should be communicated to
[dibsi.training@gmail.com](mailto:dibsi.training@gmail.com).  We will
strive to accomodate your needs!

* The [Yolo Bypass](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/lands/places-to-visit/yolo-bypass-wa) is a good birding and ottering area; visitors may even see a wild [Jonathan Eisen](https://phylogenomics.me/) on occasion.

## Address for shipping

If you want to order something from Amazon, shipping to campus can
be tricky.  The following address has worked well in the past:

```
Charles Titus Brown
re: <your name here>
1 Shields Ave 251 CCAH
Davis, CA 95616-5270
US
```

You'll need to contact one of the student assistants at DIBSI to retrieve
your package, however!
