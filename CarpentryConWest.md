# CarpentryCon West 2018

Join us for CarpentryCon West! We’ve got housing and space for Carpentries folks of all stripes — from new fans to veteran community-members, from all disciplines, near and far.  

## When: Friday, June 29 - Sunday, July 1, 2018
Carpentry Con will run from Friday evening through Sunday morning in sunny Davis, California. 

## What to expect
- Lots of social time with a small, friendly Carpentries community!
- Keynote address from [Anelda van der Walt](https://twitter.com/aneldavdw) on  Carpentries communities in Africa
- Other keynotes (TBD!) 
- Discussions about our new **Spanish curriculum**
- An introduction to **Binder** as an instructional tool and a hackyfest to *binderize* repositories 
- **Un-conference** style activities proposed by attendees

## Contibute your ideas!

Is there a specific issue or problem you want to tackle with your fellow Carpenters? Do you have a project or idea in the works that needs support or collaborators? We’re happy to facilitate! 

If you would like to propose an activity for Carpentry Con to run concurrently with other sessions, open an issue [here](https://github.com/dib-lab/CarpentryConWest18).

## Cost

Registration is $50. 

Housing is available, which includes breakfast and dinner (but not lunch). If you’re coming from afar, you’ll need to register *soon* to guarantee on-campus housing, which is an unbeatable deal and includes breakfast and dinner. 

## Code of Conduct

All contributions are expected to follow the Carpentries' [code of conduct](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/).
