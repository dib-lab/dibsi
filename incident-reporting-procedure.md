# Attendee Procedure For Reporting Code of Conduct Incidents

## Attendee Procedure

If you believe someone is in physical danger, consult with a volunteer or staff member for the appropriate crisis number, non-emergency number, or police number. Contact information will also be posted at the venue, sent in your e-mail, and on the event slack.

If you believe someone has violated the workshop [Code of Conduct](coc.html), we encourage you to report it. If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We are fine with receiving reports where we decide to take no action for the sake of creating a safer space.

You may make an anonymous report via [our online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAn2tfzZwtv_yF-LGYyzKvysqjEDA6HklYKJUwwjGC62Tj6A/viewform). This report will be seen by all lead incident responders.

During the conference you can also make a report to any helper, lead instructor, or organizer, or via e-mail.
 
In the event of a conflict of interest, you may directly contact any of the lead incident responders:
* Titus Brown
* Karen Word
* Marian Schmidt

Contact information for the lead incident responders will be available at
the venue as well as in your e-mail and on the event slack.

Carol Willing is an external senior member of the open source community who has agreed to serve as an external incident responder. Ms. Willing is completely independent of the ANGUS and DIBSI events. You can contact her at [willingc@willingconsulting.com](mailto:willingc@willingconsulting.com).

## Report Data

If you make a report via email or phone, please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Date and time of the incident
* Location of incident
* Whether the incident is ongoing
* Description of the incident
* Identifying information of the reported person: name, physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent, and/or identifying badge information
* Additional circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description

## Confidentiality

In cases of sexual violence and/or sexual harassment, Dr. Word and Dr. Brown [are required to notify UC Davis of the event](https://sexualviolence.ucdavis.edu/responsible-employees-0), and confidentiality cannot be kept in these cases.

All other reports will be kept confidential. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our conference attendees safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

## Report Handling Procedure

When you make a report to an incident responder, they will gather information about the incident according to the Staff Procedure For Incident Response.

After an incident responder takes the report, they will immediately consult with the lead incident responders (Titus Brown, Karen Word, and Marian Schmidt). In the event of a conflict of interest with any of the lead incident responders, they will contact Carol Willing.

If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, any one of the lead incident responders may take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone involved.

If the incident is less urgent, the three incident leads will meet within 24 hours to determine an appropriate response. Examples of possible incident responses are outlined in the ANGUS Staff Procedure For Incident Response; see also the list of [possible behavioral modifications](behavioral-modifications.html).

Before the conference, staff will have a mandatory meeting where incident response procedures will be outlined. After the conference, all incident responders will attend a debriefing session with the lead responders to discuss all incidents and determine any necessary follow-up actions.

## Following Up With Reporters

Within one week of an incident report, the lead responders will follow up with the person who made the report using any contact information available. The follow up may include:

* An acknowledgment that the ANGUS lead responders discussed the situation
* Whether or not the report was determined to be a violation of the Code of Conduct
* What actions (if any) were taken to correcting the reporter behavior
* In some cases, the lead responders may need to ask additional questions about the incident in order to identify the reported person.

## Conflicts of Interest

If an incident responder has a conflict of interest for a report, they will be excluded from the discussion and handling of the incident. The incident documentation will not be available to them, and they will excuse themselves from any conversations involving handling the incident.

Should two out of the three lead incident responders need to recuse themselves, Carol Willing will step in as a lead incident responder.
