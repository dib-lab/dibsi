# CarpentryConnect Davis 2018

_Note: If you are looking for the international CarpentryCon event taking place in Dublin on 30 May - 1 June, 2018, please visit [carpentrycon.org](http://www.carpentrycon.org/)._

## You're invited!

We’re inviting Carpentries folks of all stripes — from new fans to veteran community-members, from all disciplines, near and far — to join us for CarpentryConnect Davis! We’ve got housing and space for [DIBSI 2018](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/), our annual bioinformatics summer institute, so we’ve set aside **Friday evening through Sunday morning, June 29-July 1**, for a Carpentries gathering in sunny Davis, California.

## What to expect
- Lots of social time with a small, friendly Carpentries community!
- Keynote address from [Anelda van der Walt](https://twitter.com/aneldavdw) on  Carpentries communities in Africa
- Other keynotes (TBD!) 
- Discussions about our new **Spanish curriculum**
- An introduction to **Binder** as an instructional tool and a hackyfest to *binderize* repositories 
- On-boarding and **mentorship** opportunities to help new and experienced instructors connect and become familiar with Carpentries curriculum
- **Check-out opportunities** for new instructors! Attendance will be counted as your Discussion session requirement, and we will also offer Demo opportunities for anyone who needs it!
- **Un-conference** style activities proposed by attendees

It’s also worth noting that we still have room at our Carpentries Instructor Training (with Anelda and Sher!) on June 25-26, and will be running a variety of Carpentries workshops on June 27-28. See [DIBSI 2018](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/) for more details!
