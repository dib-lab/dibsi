# DIBSI Code of Conduct for 2019

## Introduction

All DIBSI attendees are expected to agree with the following code of
conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation
from all attendees to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

Please see the [Event Guidelines and Expectations](event-expectations.html) for more information.

Enforcement may result in one or more
[behavioral modifications](behavioral-modifications.html) intended to
ensure that this workshop continues to be a safe and welcoming
teaching and learning environment.

## The Quick Version

DIBSI events are neither a dating scene nor an intellectual contest.

DIBSI is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any DIBSI venue.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Attendees asked to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or if you are uncertain whether someoneâ€™s behavior might constitute harassment or have any other concerns, please contact any of the helpers, lead instructors, or organizers immediately. For more information, see the [Attendee Procedure for Reporting Code of Conduct Incidents](incident-reporting-procedure.html).

We expect participants to follow these guidelines at any DIBSI-organized event.
