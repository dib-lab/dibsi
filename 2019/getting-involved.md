# Getting involved

We are seeking teaching assistants for some or all of the [ANGUS](ANGUS.html)
workshop (July 1-July 13).

## What's in it for me?

Here is our sales pitch for your time:

* Everyone participating will have travel and lodging reimbursed, of course.

* Lead instructors and workshop leaders will receive an honorarium,
  funds and employment status permitting.

* You can learn by teaching!

* There will be lots of networking with instructors and students, and
  maybe you'll find that next job (or job candidate).

* We can arrange a day or two off for you to explore Northern California,
  which is (a) really pretty and (b) mostly within day-trip range
  (see [Venue](VENUE.html)).

## What experience should I have?

As our workshops are "Carpentry style", we will strongly prefer
badged Software and Data Carpentry instructors for all roles.

Lead instructors should have some significant genomics or bioinformatics
hands-on experience, although it need not be very broad.

Workshop leaders should be knowledgeable in the subject area of their
workshop.

TAs need not be particular experts but should be familiar with git and
the UNIX command line.

## Anything else I should know?

All material generated and used during the workshop must be licensed
under an open license (generally CC-BY).

We're hoping to provide digital badges acknowledging your roles!
