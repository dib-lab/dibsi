# Possible behavioral modifications

Our goal is to provide a safe and welcoming environment for learning
and teaching. As such, all participants must agree to and follow the
[event Code of Conduct](coc.html). Our main goal in Code of Conduct
enforcement is to ensure that negative or harassing behavior does not
continue or repeat, and that our participants (including workshop
organizers, lecturers, helpers, and attendees) feel safe.

Incident responders may require workshop participants to immediately
stop a particular behavior and/or to leave a room or the workshop for
up to a full day.

In response to an incident report, the Lead Incident Responders (Titus
Brown, Karen Word, Marian Schmidt, Rocio Martinez-Nunez, and/or Carol
Willing) may ask event participants to change rooms and/or leave the
event entirely, as well as other behavioral modifications intended to
ensure a safe and welcoming envoronment.

In cases of sexual violence and/or sexual harassment, Dr. Word and
Dr. Brown
[are required to notify UC Davis of the event](https://sexualviolence.ucdavis.edu/responsible-employees-0)
and UC Davis may also mandate specific actions.

Illegal actions may be reported to UC Davis Campus Police or other
authorities.
