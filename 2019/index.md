## 2019 Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute at UC Davis

From June 24th - July 13th, 2019 we're planning to run several
computational training events at the University of California, Davis
-- the main event will be the 10th annual ANGUS workshop, a two-week
workshop for biologists to learn basic bioinformatics and cloud
computing.  We may also run a Software Carpentry Instructor Training
and several Software and Data Carpentry workshops.

All of this will be taking place at the UC Davis School of Veterinary
Medicine, on the main campus of UC Davis (in Davis,
CA). [Read more...](VENUE.html)

Everyone is welcome, from everywhere! Grad students, postdocs,
faculty, staff, industry, non-profits, teachers, journalists, and
grant managers may all find these workshops useful. **We welcome
applications from international students.**

The two week workshop will cost approximately $950, and room & board
will be approximately $1000 total for non-local attendees (excluding
lunch).
